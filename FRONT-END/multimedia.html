      The <strong>Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)</strong> is a professional
      Twenty20 franchise cricket team based in Bengaluru, Karnataka, which
      competes in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Founded in 2008 by United
      Spirits, the team plays its home matches at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
      Known for its passionate and loyal fanbase, often referred to as the "12th
      Man Army," RCB has historically featured global cricket superstars such as
      Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, and Chris Gayle. Despite reaching the IPL
      final on three occasions (2009, 2011, and 2016) and having a star-studded
      lineup for many years, the franchise had earned a reputation as
      "underachievers" for its inability to secure the coveted IPL trophy until
      recently. The team's women's counterpart, also owned by United Spirits,
      won the Women's Premier League (WPL) title in 2024, marking the
      franchise's first-ever title across both leagues.
